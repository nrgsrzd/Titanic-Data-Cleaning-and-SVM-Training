The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset that provides a comprehensive view of the Titanic's passengers. In this exercise, we will fully examine the dataset.
Then we proceed to data preprocessing. Several key preprocessing techniques, including feature normalization and standardization, are used to ensure uniformity in numerical features. In addition, binning is implemented to discretize continuous variables. Categorical feature encoding is used to convert non-numerical variables into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms and increases the interpretability of the model. Missing values management is also an important part of data preprocessing.
The main objective of this exercise is to use Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict outcomes. The regularization parameter (C) acts as a hyperparameter on the performance of the model. To evaluate the SVM model, different values of C are tested using 10-fold cross validation and 3-way hold out.
The evaluation criteria include accuracy, recall, precision and AUC. Through detailed analysis, we compare the performance of the model under hyperparameter variations.
